## Nature conservation: priority-setting needs a global change [@Freudenberger2013]

### Synopsis

- Limited resources dedicated to conservation call for an efficient prioritization scheme
- Priority setting scheme based on ecological indicators as well as social end economic indicators
- Aim is to prioritize areas that not only provide the most ecosystem services but show high adaptive capacity towards the changing environment

### Keywords

- Interdisciplinary conservation planning
- Proactive conservation planning 
- Climate change; Insensa GIS

---

### Premises

- Political decisions about what to conserve are often based on ethical and philosophical principles
- For example, prioritization of charismatic species is driven by societal preferences
- Other factors, based on ecological theory and practical assumptions, play a role in such decisions
- While it is possible to integrate many different perspectives at the local scale, it gets harder to do so at a global scale

> Anthropogenic environmental change, more specifically the combined effects of
expanding and intensifying human land use and climate change, push many of Earthâ€™s ecosystems close to their tipping points, and in some cases beyond thresholds of tolerance [@Freudenberger2013]

---

- Globally speaking, there is no unifying aim to prevent that the ecosystem reaches a point of no return
- Conservation approaches on a global scale often fail to understand the complexity inherent to the interaction of biodiversity loss and the processes of global change causing it and, in a positive feedback spiral, fueling this process
- It is necessary to adopt a complex whole ecosystem approach
- The concept of ecosystem thermodynamics has been proposed

Blue to yellow areas indicate low to high values. Data of a, b, c and d were normalized to a range of 0--100. Class breaks have been calculated with the Jenks Breaks algorithm. After @Freudenberger2013](./consPriorities_1.png)

## Beta diversity

- Beta diversity, as proposed by @Whittaker1975, is a measure of species uniqueness between local areas
- High values of beta diversity correspond to greater variability in species composition between local areas within a region
- There are many formulation of this index. The simpler one is a measure of species turnover, calculated as $\beta=(S/\alpha)-1$, with $S$ as the total number of species in the region, and $\alpha$ as the average number of species per site within the region

. . .

```{r betareview, echo=F}
library("vegan")
data(BCI)
plantDivExcercise <- BCI[1:10, c(144, 186, 208, 216, 223)]
species_names <- rep(NA, ncol(plantDivExcercise))
for (i in 1:ncol(plantDivExcercise)){
  species_names[i] <- paste("Sp_", i, sep = "")
}  
names(plantDivExcercise) <- species_names
pdiv <- plantDivExcercise[1:4, ]
knitr::kable(pdiv, 
             row.names = F,
             align = "ccccc") %>% 
  kable_styling(font_size = 30, full_width = T)
```

---

$$
\beta=\frac{5}{(5+4+5+5)/4}-1 = 0.052
$$

. . .


- Another working example

```{r betareview2, echo=F}
pdiv2 <- data.frame(Sp_1 = c(22, 0, 0, 0),
                    Sp_2 = c(0, 27, 0, 0),
                    Sp_3 = c(0, 0, 15, 0),
                    Sp_4 = c(0, 0, 0, 11),
                    Sp_5 = c(0, 3, 0, 5))
knitr::kable(pdiv2, 
             row.names = F,
             align = "ccccc") %>% 
  kable_styling(font_size = 30, full_width = T)
```

. . .

$$
\beta=\frac{5}{(1+2+1+2)/4}-1 = 2.333
$$

## Background extinction rate

- From fossil records we know that fossil species last from $10^6$ to $10^7$ years [@Pimm1995]
- At this rate, we should observe one extinction in any sample where the sum of all of the years over all of the species under consideration is one million
- Follow the fates of 10,000 bird species for one century, for example, and one should observe just one extinction

. . .

- 1230 species of birds have been described since 1900. Since their description, 13 have gone extinct. This cohort has accumulated 98334 species-years, meaning that one species has been known for 80 years. How does this extinction rate compare with the background extinction rate?

## Jolly-Seber

- Jolly-Seber [@Jolly1965; @Seber1982] is the method of election to estimate N starting from multiple sampling occasions

- When working with multiple sampling occasions we first need to work out some numbers that will be useful to estimate the quantity of interest

- The following set of four numbers are needed in order to begin the calculation

    - $n_i$ = total number of animals caught in the $i^{th}$ sample
    - $R_i$ = number of animals that are released after the $i^{th}$ sample
    - $m_i$ = number of animals in the $i^{th}$ sample that carry marks from previous captures
    - $m_{ij}$ = number of animals in the $i^{th}$ sample that were most recently caught in the $j^{th}$ sample

---

---

![Summary of capture data from previous table. After @Sutherland1996, p. 121](./js_2.png)

---

- Having worked out the numbers with various capture histories and used these to produce the
four sets of key numbers
-   $z_i$ = the number of animals caught both before and after the $i^{th}$ sample but not in the $i^{th}$ sample itself.
-   $r_i$ = the number of animals that were released from the $i^{th}$ sample and were subsequently recaptured [@Sutherland1996].

![Capture history data sourced from @Jolly1965](./js_3.png)

---

-   $M_i$ = number of marked animals in the population when the $i^{th}$ sample is taken (but not including animals newly marked in the $i^{th}$ sample).

$$
    \label{mi}
    \tag{5.1}
    m_1 + (R_i + 1)z_i /(r_i + 1)
$$

-   $N_i$ = population size at the time of the $i^{th}$ sample.

$$
    \label{ni}
    \tag{5.2}
    M_i (n_i + 1)/(m_i + 1)
    $$

-   $\phi_i$ = proportion of the population surviving (and remaining in the study area) from the $i^{th}$ sampling occasion to the $(i + 1)^{th}$.\
    $$
    \label{fi}
    \tag{5.3}
    M_{i+1}/(M_i âˆ’ m_i + R_1)
    $$

---

-   $B_i$ = number of animals that enter the population between the $i^{th}$ and $(i + 1)^{th}$ samples and survive until the $(i + 1)^{th}$ sampling occasion. 

$$
    \label{bi}
    \tag{5.4}
    N_{i+1} âˆ’ \phi_i (N_i âˆ’ n_i + R_i)
$$ 

-   $M_2 = 10 + (143 + 1)14/(80 + 1) = 34.89$

-   $N_2 = 34.89(146 + 1)/(10 + 1) = 466.1$

-   $\phi_2 = 169.46/(34.89 âˆ’ 10 + 143) = 1.009$

-   $B_2 = 758.1 âˆ’ 1.009(466.2 âˆ’ 146 + 143) = 290.7$

<br/>

- Note that one cannot calculate $M$ for the last sample, $N$ for the first or last, $\phi$ for the last
two and $B$ for the first or last two. $M_1$ is always zero.
