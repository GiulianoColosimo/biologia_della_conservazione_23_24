## Nature conservation: priority-setting needs a global change [@Freudenberger2013]

### Synopsis

- Limited resources dedicated to conservation call for an efficient prioritization scheme
- Priority setting scheme based on ecological indicators as well as social end economic indicators
- Aim is to prioritize areas that not only provide the most ecosystem services but show high adaptive capacity towards the changing environment

### Keywords

- Interdisciplinary conservation planning
- Proactive conservation planning 
- Climate change; Insensa GIS

---

### Premises

- Political decisions about what to conserve are often based on ethical and philosophical principles
- For example, prioritization of charismatic species is driven by societal preferences
- Other factors, based on ecological theory and practical assumptions, play a role in such decisions
- While it is possible to integrate many different perspectives at the local scale, it gets harder to do so at a global scale

> Anthropogenic environmental change, more specifically the combined effects of
expanding and intensifying human land use and climate change, push many of Earth’s ecosystems close to their tipping points, and in some cases beyond thresholds of tolerance [@Freudenberger2013]

---

- Globally speaking, there is no unifying aim to prevent that the ecosystem reaches a point of no return
- Conservation approaches on a global scale often fail to understand the complexity inherent to the interaction of biodiversity loss and the processes of global change causing it and, in a positive feedback spiral, fueling this process
- It is necessary to adopt a complex whole ecosystem approach
- The concept of ecosystem thermodynamics has been proposed

Blue to yellow areas indicate low to high values. Data of a, b, c and d were normalized to a range of 0--100. Class breaks have been calculated with the Jenks Breaks algorithm.

## Beta diversity

- Beta diversity, as proposed by @Whittaker1975, is a measure of species uniqueness between local areas
- High values of beta diversity correspond to greater variability in species composition between local areas within a region
- There are many formulation of this index. The simpler one is a measure of species turnover, calculated as $\beta=(S/\alpha)-1$, with $S$ as the total number of species in the region, and $\alpha$ as the average number of species per site within the region

. . .

```{r betareview, echo=F}
library("vegan")
data(BCI)
plantDivExcercise <- BCI[1:10, c(144, 186, 208, 216, 223)]
species_names <- rep(NA, ncol(plantDivExcercise))
for (i in 1:ncol(plantDivExcercise)){
  species_names[i] <- paste("Sp_", i, sep = "")
}  
names(plantDivExcercise) <- species_names
pdiv <- plantDivExcercise[1:4, ]
knitr::kable(pdiv, 
             row.names = F,
             align = "ccccc") %>% 
  kable_styling(font_size = 30, full_width = T)
```

---

$$
\beta=\frac{5}{(5+4+5+5)/4}-1 = 0.052
$$

. . .


- Another working example

```{r betareview2, echo=F}
pdiv2 <- data.frame(Sp_1 = c(22, 0, 0, 0),
                    Sp_2 = c(0, 27, 0, 0),
                    Sp_3 = c(0, 0, 15, 0),
                    Sp_4 = c(0, 0, 0, 11),
                    Sp_5 = c(0, 3, 0, 5))
knitr::kable(pdiv2, 
             row.names = F,
             align = "ccccc") %>% 
  kable_styling(font_size = 30, full_width = T)
```

. . .

$$
\beta=\frac{5}{(1+2+1+2)/4}-1 = 2.333
$$

## Background extinction rate

- From fossil records we know that fossil species last from $10^6$ to $10^7$ years [@Pimm1995]
- At this rate, we should observe one extinction in any sample where the sum of all of the years over all of the species under consideration is one million
- Follow the fates of 10,000 bird species for one century, for example, and one should observe just one extinction

. . .

- 1230 species of birds have been described since 1900. Since their description, 13 have gone extinct. This cohort has accumulated 98334 species-years, meaning that one species has been known for 80 years. How does this extinction rate compare with the background extinction rate?

## Jolly-Seber

- Jolly-Seber [@Jolly1965; @Seber1982] is the method of election to estimate N starting from multiple sampling occasions

- When working with multiple sampling occasions we first need to work out some numbers that will be useful to estimate the quantity of interest

- The following set of four numbers are needed in order to begin the calculation

    - $n_i$ = total number of animals caught in the $i^{th}$ sample
    - $R_i$ = number of animals that are released after the $i^{th}$ sample
    - $m_i$ = number of animals in the $i^{th}$ sample that carry marks from previous captures
    - $m_{ij}$ = number of animals in the $i^{th}$ sample that were most recently caught in the $j^{th}$ sample

---

---

![Summary of capture data from previous table. After @Sutherland1996, p. 121](./js_2.png)

---

- Having worked out the numbers with various capture histories and used these to produce the
four sets of key numbers
-   $z_i$ = the number of animals caught both before and after the $i^{th}$ sample but not in the $i^{th}$ sample itself.
-   $r_i$ = the number of animals that were released from the $i^{th}$ sample and were subsequently recaptured [@Sutherland1996].

![Capture history data sourced from @Jolly1965](./js_3.png)

---

-   $M_i$ = number of marked animals in the population when the $i^{th}$ sample is taken (but not including animals newly marked in the $i^{th}$ sample).

$$
    \label{mi}
    \tag{5.1}
    m_1 + (R_i + 1)z_i /(r_i + 1)
$$

-   $N_i$ = population size at the time of the $i^{th}$ sample.

$$
    \label{ni}
    \tag{5.2}
    M_i (n_i + 1)/(m_i + 1)
    $$

-   $\phi_i$ = proportion of the population surviving (and remaining in the study area) from the $i^{th}$ sampling occasion to the $(i + 1)^{th}$.\
    $$
    \label{fi}
    \tag{5.3}
    M_{i+1}/(M_i − m_i + R_1)
    $$

---

-   $B_i$ = number of animals that enter the population between the $i^{th}$ and $(i + 1)^{th}$ samples and survive until the $(i + 1)^{th}$ sampling occasion. 

$$
    \label{bi}
    \tag{5.4}
    N_{i+1} − \phi_i (N_i − n_i + R_i)
$$ 

-   $M_2 = 10 + (143 + 1)14/(80 + 1) = 34.89$

-   $N_2 = 34.89(146 + 1)/(10 + 1) = 466.1$

-   $\phi_2 = 169.46/(34.89 − 10 + 143) = 1.009$

-   $B_2 = 758.1 − 1.009(466.2 − 146 + 143) = 290.7$

<br/>

- Note that one cannot calculate $M$ for the last sample, $N$ for the first or last, $\phi$ for the last
two and $B$ for the first or last two. $M_1$ is always zero.
