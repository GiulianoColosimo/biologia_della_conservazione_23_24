## Population structure

-   In most species individuals are scattered in local conglomerates that are called *demes* (*i.e.*, local populations or subpopulations)

## Population structure

-   A metapopulation is defined as a set of discrete populations (demes) of the same species, in the same general geographical area, potentially able to exchange individuals through migration, dispersal, or human-mediated movement [@Akakaya2007; @Hanski1997]

-   This subdivision (or structure) of populations can be natural and/or human driven

-   Regardless of the cause, the existence of population structure in many species forces us to think at the genetic variation within a species at two primary levels:

    1.  Genetic variation within local demes.
    2.  Genetic variation bewteen local demes.

-   Not all species are scattered!

## Population structure

-   Even in the absence of barriers to gene flow, genetic differences can accrue so that individuals that are very distant from each other may present significant differences at the genetic level: isolation by distance

## Population structure

-   Describing the patterns and amount of differentiation among demes is of the uttermost importance to develop effective conservation strategies [see for example @Thatte2018].

## Population structure

![After @Colosimo2021b](./class_13_9.png)

## Population structure

-   Developing priorities for the conservation of a species often requires an understanding of adaptive genetic differentiation among populations [@Allendorf2022].
-   To understand how genetic variation is distributed at different loci within subdivided populations it is necessary to look at different interacting forces like gene flow, genetic drift and natural selection.
-   $F$ statistics [@Wright1931; @Wright1951; @Malecot1948] are undoubtedly the most used indexes to describe genetic differentiation in and between demes.
-   $F$ statistics are, in short, inbreeding coefficients measuring different types of inbreeding at different levels.

## $F$ statistics

-   We recognize three primary coefficients: $F_{IS}$, $F_{IT}$, and $F_{ST}$.
-   $F_{IS}$ measures Hardy--Weinberg departures within local demes.
-   $F_{ST}$ measures divergence in allele frequencies among demes.
-   $F_{IT}$ measures Hardy--Weinberg departures in the metapopulation due to $F_{IS}$ (nonrandom mating within local demes) and $F_{ST}$ (allele frequency divergence among demes).
-   The original $F$ statistics developed by wright focused on loci with only two alleles.
-   @Nei1977 extended these measures to multiple alleles and used a different notation to name what he called *analysis of gene diversity*: $G_{IS}$, $G_{IT}$, and $G_{ST}$. Often the two groups of indexes are used interchangeably.

## $F_{IS}$

This is a measure of departure from HW proportions within local demes.

$$
\label{fis}
\tag{13.1}
F_{IS} = 1-\frac{H_O}{H_S}
$$

where $H_O$ is the observed heterozygosity averaged over all demes while $H_S$ is the expected heterozygosity averaged over all demes. $F_{IS}$ values can range from $-1 \leq 0 \leq 1$, with positive values indicating an excess of homozygotes and negative values indicating an excess of heterozygotes [@Allendorf2022].

## $F_{ST}$

Often called *fixation index*, it is a measure of genetic divergence among demes.

$$
\label{fst}
\tag{13.2}
F_{ST} = 1-\frac{H_S}{H_T}
$$

with $H_T$ as the expected HW heterozygosity if the metapopulation were panmictic, and $H_S$ is the HW proportion of heterozygotes in each separate deme and then averaged over all demes. This measure varies from $0$ (demes all have equal allele frequencies) to $1$ (demes are all fixed for different alleles).

## $F_{IT}$

Measures the departure from HW proportions due to departures from HW proportions within local demes and divergence among demes [@Allendorf2022].

$$
\label{fit}
\tag{13.3}
F_{IT} = 1-\frac{H_O}{H_T}
$$

where $H_O$ is the observed heterozygosity averaged over all demes while $H_T$ is the expected HW heterozygosity if the metapopulation were panmictic.

. . .

-   The fixation indexes described in the previous slides are related by the following expression:

$$
\label{findexrelation}
\tag{13.4}
F_{IT}= F_{IS}+F_{ST}-(F_{IS}*F_{ST})
$$

## The Wahlund effect

-   A deficit of heterozygosity due to the presence of differential distribution of genetic diversity among demes is often called Wahlund effect, for the the Swedish geneticist who described it [@Wahlund1928].
-   He analyzed the excess of homozygotes and deficit of heterozygotes in terms of the variance of allele frequencies among S deme [@Allendorf2022].

$$
\label{wahlund}
\tag{13.5}
Var(q)=\frac{1}{S}\sum(q_i-\bar{q})^2 \\ \\ F_{ST} = \frac{Var(q)}{pq}
$$

## Population structure and habitat fragmentation

-   Habitat fragmentation is a combination of two processes: reduction in total area, and the creation of separate islands.
-   Human induced fragmentation and habitat loss is recognized as the main cause of biodiversity loss [@deBaan2013].
-   Habitat fragmentation causes an overall reduction in population size.
-   Habitat fragmentation also causes an overall reduction in gene flow among the patches it creates.
-   Inhospitable, cleared habitat among fragments typically inhibits gene flow. The same goes for roads rivers, water bodies, mountains, or any other artificial or natural barrier [@Colosimo2014, @Riley2006].
-   With restricted gene flow fragmentation is highly deleterious in the long term.
-   Single Large or Several Small [@Frankham2010].

## Population structure and habitat fragmentation

![Fragmentation of Atlantic forest. After @Luci2011](./class_13_10.png)

## Population structure and habitat fragmentation

![Single large (SL) VS several small (SS). After @Frankham2010](./class_13_11.jpg)

## Population structure and habitat fragmentation

Fragmentation happens in two steps:

1.  Initial genetic subdivision of the population.
2.  Cumulative diversification through genetic drift, selection, inbreeding etc. etc. etc.

After an initial fragmentation, different fragments will have different initial allele frequencies. This diversification can be described by the binomial sampling variance ($\sigma_p^2 = \frac{pq}{2N}$) and the smaller the fragment, the higher the variance.

. . .

The degree of differentiation among fragments can be described by partitioning the overall inbreeding into components within and among populations ($F$ statistics).

. . .

We will look at some examples on estimating $F$ statistics from genotype data.

## Population structure and habitat fragmentation

### Gene flow

What is gene flow?

-   Movement of alleles between population due to migration.

The effects of fragmentation on gene flow depend on:

-   Number of population fragments.
-   Distribution of population sizes in the fragments.
-   Distance between fragments.
-   Dispersal ability of the species.
-   Migration rates among fragments.
-   Environment of the matrix among fragments.
-   Times since fragmentation and extinction and recolonization rates across fragments.

|            |          |          |          | $q=0.5$     |     |      |

## Example - 4

![$F_{ST}$ increases over generations in fragmented populations at a rate inversely dependent on population size. Values that are $\ge 0.15$ indicate significant differentiation between fragments [@Frankham2010].](./class_13_15.jpg){fig-align="center"}

## Migration and gene flow

-   Migration reduces the impact of fragmentation in a way that is dependent on the rate of gene flow.
-   When is gene flow sufficiently high to prevent the genetic impact of fragmentation?

. . .

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   A single migrant per generation is considered sufficient to prevent differentiation between demes.
-   The migration rate $m$ is the proportion of genes in a population derived from migrants per generation.
-   $Nm$ is the number of migrants per generation [@Frankham2010].
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](./class_13_16.jpg){width="65%" fig-align="center"}
:::
:::

## Migration and gene flow

-   In reality, more than one migrant per generation is needed as not all migrants are successful at reproduction.
-   Different values have been proposed over time: 5, 1-10, $\ge$ 10 [@Mills1996; @Lacy1987; @Vucetich2000].
-   One way to overcome the issue of non idealized populations is to look at $N_em$.
-   When population size and migration rates are constant inbreeding and migration reach an equilibrium, measured by $F_{ST}$

$$
\label{fst2}
\tag{13.6}
F_{ST} = \frac{1}{4N_em+1}
$$

-   Equation \ref{fst2} applies when $m$ is small and all population sizes and migration rates among them are the same.

## Migration and gene flow

-   Measuring migration rates is complicated!
-   It is possible to rearrange equation \ref{fst} to estimate $Nm$, and this is an approach widely used. Unfortunately this approach will lead to biased results especially when different models of migration than the island model are considered.

![Migration models, after @Frankham2010](./class_13_17.jpg)

## Limitations of $F_{ST}$

-   This measure of differentiation between demes does not take in to account genealogical information (i.e., there is no information about the identity of the alleles).
-   A measure related to $F_{ST}$, called $R_{ST}$, uses information on the length of alleles at microsatellite, and assumes that each mutation changes an allele's length by only one repeat unit [@Slatkin1995; @Allendorf2022].
-   Another measure of differentiation that uses information on allele genealogical relationships is $\Phi_{ST}$ [@Excoffier1992; @Allendorf2022].
-   One more alternative is offered by @Gaggiotti2010. They have presented a method to estimate population-specific $F_{ST}$ values ($F_{ST}^′$) rather than global or pairwise $F_{ST}$ values. They define $F_{ST}^′$ s as the probability that two genes chosen at random from the population share a common ancestor within that population [@Allendorf2022].

## Limitations of $F_{ST}$

-   $F_{ST}$ (and its analog $G_{ST}$) has limitations when using loci with high mutation rates and high heterozygosities, such as microsatellites. $F_{ST}$ is biased downward when variation within subpopulations ($H_S$) is high. The source of this bias is obvious: when variation within populations is high, the proportion of the total variation distributed between populations can never be very high [@Allendorf2022].

    -   @Hedrick2005 introduced $G_{ST}^′$, which is $G_{ST}$ divided by its maximum possible values with the same overall allele frequencies. Thus, $G_{ST}^′$ has a range from 0 to 1, and was designed to be independent of $H_S$. If $H_S$ is high, then $G_{ST}^′$ can be much greater than $G_{ST}$. $G_{ST}^′$ is designed to be a standardized measure of $G_{ST}$, which accounts for different levels of total genetic variation at different loci [@Allendorf2022].

## Hierarchical population structure

-   Populations are often structured at multiple hierarchical levels; for example, locally and regionally.

![Organization of hierarchical population structure with two levels of subdivision: subpopulations within regions ($F_{SR}$) and regions within the total species ($F_{RT}$). Each region has two subpopulations. $F_{SR}$ is the proportion of the total diversity due to differences between subpopulations within regions. $F_{RT}$ is the proportion of the total diversity due to differences between regions [@Allendorf2022].](./class_13_18.png)

## Alternative approach to estimating $Nm$

-   Another indirect estimator of $Nm$ is the private allele method [@Slatkin1987].
-   A private allele is one found in only one population. Slatkin showed that a linear relationship exists between $Nm$ and the average frequency of private alleles. This method works because if gene flow ($Nm$) is low, populations will have numerous private alleles that arise through mutation, for example.
-   The time during which a new allele remains private depends only on migration rates, such that the proportion of alleles that are private decreases as migration rate increases. If gene flow is high, private alleles will be uncommon [@Allendorf2022].
-   This method could be less biased than the $F_{ST}$-island model method, when using highly polymorphic markers, because it apparently is less sensitive to problems of homoplasy created by back mutations than is the $F_{ST}$ method [@Allen1995].

## Assignment tests

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Assignment tests offer an attractive alternative to the traditional capture--mark--recapture approach to estimating $Nm$ directly.

-   For example, we can genotype many individuals in a single population sample, and then determine the proportion of "immigrant" individuals; that is, individuals with a foreign genotype that are unlikely to have originated locally.

## Hybridization

-   Rates of hybridization and introgression have increased dramatically worldwide because of widespread intentional and incidental translocations of organisms and habitat modifications by humans [@Allendorf2022].

-   Rates of hybridization and introgression have increased dramatically worldwide because of widespread intentional and incidental translocations of organisms and habitat modifications by humans [@Allendorf2022].

-   The increasing pace of the three interacting human activities that contribute most to increased rates of hybridization (introductions of plants and animals, fragmentation, and habitat modification) suggests that this problem will become even more serious in the future [@Allendorf2022]

-   For example, increased turbidity in Lake Victoria, Africa, has reduced color perception of cichlid fishes and has interfered with the mate choice that produced reproductive isolation among species [@Seehausen1997; @Allendorf2022]

## Hybridization

-   On the other hand, hybridization is a natural part of the evolutionary process [@Allendorf2022].

-   Hybridization has long been recognized as playing an important role in the evolution of plants.

-   In addition, recent studies have found that hybridization has also played an important role in the evolution of animals

-   Many early conservation policies generally did not allow protection of hybrids. However, increased appreciation of the important role of hybridization as an evolutionary process has caused a re-evaluation of these policies. Determining whether hybridization is natural or anthropogenic is crucial for conservation, but is often difficult [@Allendorf2022].

How can we use all the genetic data we have learnt to gather and analyse?

<br/>

. . .

1.  Clarification of relatedness, taxonomy and phylogeny among populations.

. . .

2.  Determination of population management units based on genetic criteria.

. . .

3.  Estimation of gene flow and dispersal among populations.

. . .

4.  Determination of the time since past genetic bottlenecks in a population or the time since significant differentiation between populations.

5.  Understanding patterns of reproductive ecology.

6.  Locating original sources of wildlife products.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. Clarification of relatedness, taxonomy and phylogeny among populations.

-   The most basic question in conservation biology: how many species are there?
-   Assessing the taxonomy of one population or species still remains one of the most important applications of conservation genetics.
-   Until 1970 various taxonomic units were classified using morphological features.
-   In 1973 the Endangered Species Act (ESA, US Gov.) extended legal protection to species and subspecies.

> When taxonomic distinction became the basis for legal protection...the innocence was lost forever [@Obrien1996].

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Determination of population management units based on genetic criteria.

-   On what basis we delimit meaningful management units in the wild?

-   The genetic differences as measured by the $F_{ST}$ statistics provide an objective criterion for defining population management units.

-   Combining nuclear and mtDNA markers it was possible to identify 4 demographically autonomous population units, a northeastern India unit, a central India unit, and 2 genetically distinct unit in the south of India to be administrered separately because of their genetic uniqueness. These units were radically different from what had been proposed solely on the political considerations [@Vidya2005].

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Estimation of gene flow and dispersal among populations.

-   Managing gene flow between populations, through a detailed analysis of $F_{ST}$ patterns, can help to better understand and define the individuals that could be used in translocation projects, when to do so, and the duration of the whole translocation process [@Allendorf2022].

-   Consideration about gene flow rates are extremely important in the management of wild plant and animal populations.

-   @Dolan1999 indirectly estimated gene flow measuring the genetic differentiation of three rare species of perennial scrubs in Florida. In one of them, *Hypericum cumulicola*, gene flow was absent. The limited genetic variation detected in this species limits the adaptive response of it to future environmental changes and makes it more prone to extinction.

## 6. Locating original sources of wildlife products.

-   The International Whaling Commission (IWC) imposed a moratorium on commercial whaling in 1982 [@Allendorf2022].

-   A small quota of very specific species of whales was still available to countries like Japan and South Korea.

> The source of these products was assumed to be undocumented \`incidental takes' from fisheries' by-catch, although we cannot exclude the possibility of illegal hunting or smuggling. The demographic impact of this undocumented exploitation was evaluated using the model of population dynamics adopted by the Scienti¢c Committee of the International Whaling Commission. For the range of exploitation consistent with the market sample, this protected stock was predicted to decline towards extinction over the next few decades [@Baker2000].

## Managing genetic diversity in wild populations

-   The IUCN lists the common adder, *Vipera berus*, as in the category [Least Concern](https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/47756146/743903). It has a very widespread distribution, although populations are fragmented in small and often isolated demes.

-   One isolated population of this species, in Sweden, declined in 1960s and then began to exhibit the a high proportion of deformed and stillborn offspring coupled with low genetic variability, i.e., signs of inbreeding depression [@Madsen1999].

-   @Madsen1999 introduced 20 youg adder individuals collected from larger and more genetically diverse population in this declining population. After only 4 years, the time needed for an adder to become reproductively active, started to document a reduction in still born babies and a reduction in deformities and an increase in genetic diversity.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Hybridization and introgression are two important factors to monitor in wild populations.

-   When two closely related species coexist and one of them is more rare, the rare one risks to be genetically swamped due to hybridization and/or introgression (the incorporation of genetic material from a species/population/subpopulation into the genome of another) [@Allendorf2022].

-   A very well documented example of managing genetic problems in wildlife population comes from the red wolf (*Canis rufus*) from south-central United States.

-   In 1975 red wolf became extinct in the wild [@Avise1996]. The united States Fish and Wildlife Services (USFWS) initiated a campaign to re-establish a population of this species using captive-bred individuals.

-   Released individuals became established and that area was designed as the Red Wolf Experimental Population Area (RWEP-A).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   The biggest threat was not much the hybridization between red wolves and coyotes (*Canis latrans*), but the backcrossing between $F_1$ hybrids and adult red wolf individuals (i.e., introgression).

## Managing genetic diversity in captive populations

-   Attempts at turkey reintroduction using captive bred individuals were a failure in 95% of cases in the united States [@Allendorf2022].

-   As @Leopold1944 said:

> Wild turkey are wary and shy, which are advantageous characteristics in eluding natural and human enemies. The hens and young ones automatically react to threats in ways that are self protective...Birds of the domestic strain, on the other hand, are differently adapted. Many of their physiological reaction and psychological characteristics are favorable to existence in the barnyard but may perclude existence in the wild.

-   The problem stated above is present in every single population and it is known as *adaptation to captivity* [@Allendorf2022].

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   The more accustomed wild animals become to their artificial environment the less likely they are to survive when reintroduced in the wild.

-   Lifetime reproductive success of and overall fitness of stealhead trout (*Oncorhynchus mykiss*) declined precipitously in just two generations of captivity [@Araki2007].

-   The data provided in @Araki2007 suggest that 37.5% fitness decline per captive reared generation demonstrating that genetic adaptation (GA) to captivity is something dangerous that should not be underestimated.

-   GA can be mathematically described:

$$
\label{ga}
\tag{13.7}
GA = \frac{Sh^2}{L}\sum_{i=1}^{\frac{y}{L}}[1-\frac{1}{2N_e}]^{\frac{y}{L}}(1-m_i)
$$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Where $S$ is the selection differential in captivity (the strength in selection for captive traits).
-   $h^2$ is heritability (additive genetic variation for reproductive fitness).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Heritability

-   The heritability of a character is probably the most important determinant of individuals to evolve in response to selection!

-   Heritability is the proportion of phenotypic variance in a population due to genetic differences that parents can pass through offspring in the next generation.

-   Heritability is symbolized $h^2$, but the superscript has no mathematical meaning!

-   Molecular measures of genetic diversity do not often answer some of the questions we try to address in conservation genetics as correlation between molecular and quantitative measures of genetic diversity are low.

-   The heritability associated with quantitative characters that are related to reproductive fitness are of great interests to conservation biologists.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

![Distribution of phenotypes for 5 quantitative characters that are very important for reproductive fitness. After @Frankham2010](./class_13_28.jpg)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Quantitative traits are influenced by mani loci plus environmental influences (feeding, exposure to sunlight, water availability et. etc. etc.).

-   It is not possible to directly infer genotype from phenotype only when we refer to quantitative characters, and individuals with the same genotype may have different genotypes, or individuals with the same genotypes may have different phenotype.

-   Genetic diversity for quantitative characters in outbred populations is due to the segregation of multiple mendelian loci referred to as Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL).

-   QTLs possess alleles that add to or detract from the magnitude of the quantitative character.

-   How do we measure what portion of the phenotypic variance for quantitative traits derives from genetic variation among individuals?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  Variation within and among populations.
2.  Comparison of inbred with outbred populations.
3.  Resemblance among relatives.

-   Because of the great impact that the environment can have on the expression of quantitative traits characters it is extremely important that all comparisons are carried out in a controlled situation and synchronously (i.e., at the same time): common garden experiment.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

![Quantitative genetic variation for corolla length in tobacco. After @Strickberger1985.](./class_13_29.jpg)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

$$
\label{ga2}
\tag{13.8}
GA = \frac{Sh^2}{L}\sum_{i=1}^{\frac{y}{L}}[1-\frac{1}{2N_e}]^{\frac{y}{L}}(1-m_i)
$$

-   Where $S$ is the selection differential in captivity (the strength in selection for captive traits).
-   $h^2$ is heritability (additive genetic variation for reproductive fitness).
-   $y/L$ number of generations in captivity ($y$ = years, $L$ = generation length).
-   $N_e$, you should recognize this one....
-   $m_i$ proportion of genetic material coming from immigrants.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### What could we do to minimize GA?

-   Reduce the amount of time in captivity (i.e., reduce the number of iterations $\sum_{i=1}^{y/L}$).
-   Reduce the strength of selection, $S$, in captivity. Very complicated, as it entails making the captive environment as similar as possible to the natural environment, both at the biotic and the abiotic level.
-   Add more immigrants (unrelated individuals) from wild or captive populations to slow the rate of genetic adaptation.

Understanding the intentions, methods and scope of the management plans is essential if we want to grasp the way in which captive populations are integrated into worldwide conservation strategies today [@Allendorf2022].
