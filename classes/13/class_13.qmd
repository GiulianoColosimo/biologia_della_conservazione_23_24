## Population structure

-   In most species individuals are scattered in local conglomerates that are called *demes* (*i.e.*, local populations or subpopulations)

## Population structure

-   A metapopulation is defined as a set of discrete populations (demes) of the same species, in the same general geographical area, potentially able to exchange individuals through migration, dispersal, or human-mediated movement [@Akakaya2007; @Hanski1997]

-   This subdivision (or structure) of populations can be natural and/or human driven

-   Regardless of the cause, the existence of population structure in many species forces us to think at the genetic variation within a species at two primary levels:

    1.  Genetic variation within local demes.
    2.  Genetic variation bewteen local demes.

-   Not all species are scattered!

## Population structure

-   Even in the absence of barriers to gene flow, genetic differences can accrue so that individuals that are very distant from each other may present significant differences at the genetic level: isolation by distance

![Variability in the correlation between species genetic diversity and geographic distance. ranges. Modified from @Forbes1999 with additional unpublished data from M.K. Schwartz [@Allendorf2022].](./class_13_5.png)

## Population structure

-   Describing the patterns and amount of differentiation among demes is of the uttermost importance to develop effective conservation strategies [see for example @Thatte2018].

## Population structure

![After @Colosimo2021b](./class_13_9.png)

## Population structure

-   Developing priorities for the conservation of a species often requires an understanding of adaptive genetic differentiation among populations [@Allendorf2022].
-   To understand how genetic variation is distributed at different loci within subdivided populations it is necessary to look at different interacting forces like gene flow, genetic drift and natural selection.
-   $F$ statistics [@Wright1931; @Wright1951; @Malecot1948] are undoubtedly the most used indexes to describe genetic differentiation in and between demes.
-   $F$ statistics are, in short, inbreeding coefficients measuring different types of inbreeding at different levels.

## $F$ statistics

-   We recognize three primary coefficients: $F_{IS}$, $F_{IT}$, and $F_{ST}$.
-   $F_{IS}$ measures Hardy--Weinberg departures within local demes.
-   $F_{ST}$ measures divergence in allele frequencies among demes.
-   $F_{IT}$ measures Hardy--Weinberg departures in the metapopulation due to $F_{IS}$ (nonrandom mating within local demes) and $F_{ST}$ (allele frequency divergence among demes).
-   The original $F$ statistics developed by wright focused on loci with only two alleles.
-   @Nei1977 extended these measures to multiple alleles and used a different notation to name what he called *analysis of gene diversity*: $G_{IS}$, $G_{IT}$, and $G_{ST}$. Often the two groups of indexes are used interchangeably.

## $F_{IS}$

This is a measure of departure from HW proportions within local demes.

$$
\label{fis}
\tag{13.1}
F_{IS} = 1-\frac{H_O}{H_S}
$$

where $H_O$ is the observed heterozygosity averaged over all demes while $H_S$ is the expected heterozygosity averaged over all demes. $F_{IS}$ values can range from $-1 \leq 0 \leq 1$, with positive values indicating an excess of homozygotes and negative values indicating an excess of heterozygotes [@Allendorf2022].

## $F_{ST}$

Often called *fixation index*, it is a measure of genetic divergence among demes.

$$
\label{fst}
\tag{13.2}
F_{ST} = 1-\frac{H_S}{H_T}
$$

with $H_T$ as the expected HW heterozygosity if the metapopulation were panmictic, and $H_S$ is the HW proportion of heterozygotes in each separate deme and then averaged over all demes. This measure varies from $0$ (demes all have equal allele frequencies) to $1$ (demes are all fixed for different alleles).

## $F_{IT}$

Measures the departure from HW proportions due to departures from HW proportions within local demes and divergence among demes [@Allendorf2022].

$$
\label{fit}
\tag{13.3}
F_{IT} = 1-\frac{H_O}{H_T}
$$

where $H_O$ is the observed heterozygosity averaged over all demes while $H_T$ is the expected HW heterozygosity if the metapopulation were panmictic.

. . .

-   The fixation indexes described in the previous slides are related by the following expression:

$$
\label{findexrelation}
\tag{13.4}
F_{IT}= F_{IS}+F_{ST}-(F_{IS}*F_{ST})
$$

## The Wahlund effect

-   A deficit of heterozygosity due to the presence of differential distribution of genetic diversity among demes is often called Wahlund effect, for the the Swedish geneticist who described it [@Wahlund1928].
-   He analyzed the excess of homozygotes and deficit of heterozygotes in terms of the variance of allele frequencies among S deme [@Allendorf2022].

$$
\label{wahlund}
\tag{13.5}
Var(q)=\frac{1}{S}\sum(q_i-\bar{q})^2 \\ \\ F_{ST} = \frac{Var(q)}{pq}
$$

## Population structure and habitat fragmentation

-   Habitat fragmentation is a combination of two processes: reduction in total area, and the creation of separate islands.
-   Human induced fragmentation and habitat loss is recognized as the main cause of biodiversity loss [@deBaan2013].
-   Habitat fragmentation causes an overall reduction in population size.
-   Habitat fragmentation also causes an overall reduction in gene flow among the patches it creates.
-   Inhospitable, cleared habitat among fragments typically inhibits gene flow. The same goes for roads rivers, water bodies, mountains, or any other artificial or natural barrier [@Colosimo2014, @Riley2006].
-   With restricted gene flow fragmentation is highly deleterious in the long term.
-   Single Large or Several Small [@Frankham2010].

## Population structure and habitat fragmentation

## Population structure and habitat fragmentation

![Single large (SL) VS several small (SS). After @Frankham2010](./class_13_11.jpg)

## Population structure and habitat fragmentation

Fragmentation happens in two steps:

1.  Initial genetic subdivision of the population.
2.  Cumulative diversification through genetic drift, selection, inbreeding etc. etc. etc.

After an initial fragmentation, different fragments will have different initial allele frequencies. This diversification can be described by the binomial sampling variance ($\sigma_p^2 = \frac{pq}{2N}$) and the smaller the fragment, the higher the variance.

. . .

The degree of differentiation among fragments can be described by partitioning the overall inbreeding into components within and among populations ($F$ statistics).

. . .

We will look at some examples on estimating $F$ statistics from genotype data.

## Population structure and habitat fragmentation

### Gene flow

What is gene flow?

-   Movement of alleles between population due to migration.

The effects of fragmentation on gene flow depend on:

-   Number of population fragments.
-   Distribution of population sizes in the fragments.
-   Distance between fragments.
-   Dispersal ability of the species.
-   Migration rates among fragments.
-   Environment of the matrix among fragments.
-   Times since fragmentation and extinction and recolonization rates across fragments.

|            |          |          |          | $q=0.5$     |     |      |

## Example - 4

![$F_{ST}$ increases over generations in fragmented populations at a rate inversely dependent on population size. Values that are $\ge 0.15$ indicate significant differentiation between fragments [@Frankham2010].](./class_13_15.jpg){fig-align="center"}

## Migration and gene flow

-   Migration reduces the impact of fragmentation in a way that is dependent on the rate of gene flow.
-   When is gene flow sufficiently high to prevent the genetic impact of fragmentation?

. . .

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   A single migrant per generation is considered sufficient to prevent differentiation between demes.
-   The migration rate $m$ is the proportion of genes in a population derived from migrants per generation.
-   $Nm$ is the number of migrants per generation [@Frankham2010].
