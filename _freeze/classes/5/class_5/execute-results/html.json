The simpler one is a measure of species turnover, calculated as $\\beta=(S/\\alpha)-1$, with $S$ as the total number of species in the region, and $\\alpha$ as the average number of species per site within the region\n\n. . .\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table\" style=\"font-size: 30px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:center;\"> Sp_1 </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:center;\"> Sp_2 </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:center;\"> Sp_3 </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:center;\"> Sp_4 </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:center;\"> Sp_5 </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 22 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 2 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 18 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 17 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 2 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 21 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 0 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 27 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 12 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 2 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 14 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 3 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 28 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 11 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 2 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 23 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 3 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 35 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 16 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 5 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n$$\n\\beta=\\frac{5}{(5+4+5+5)/4}-1 = 0.052\n$$\n\n. . .\n\n-   Another working example\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table\" style=\"font-size: 30px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:center;\"> Sp_1 </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:center;\"> Sp_2 </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:center;\"> Sp_3 </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:center;\"> Sp_4 </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:center;\"> Sp_5 </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 22 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 0 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 0 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 0 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 0 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 0 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 27 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 0 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 0 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 3 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 0 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 0 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 15 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 0 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 0 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 0 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 0 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 0 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 11 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 5 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\n. . .\n\n$$\n\\beta=\\frac{5}{(1+2+1+2)/4}-1 = 2.333\n$$\n\n## Background extinction rate\n\n-   From fossil records we know that fossil species last from $10^6$ to $10^7$ years [@Pimm1995]\n-   At this rate, we should observe one extinction in any sample where the sum of all of the years over all of the species under consideration is one million\n-   Follow the fates of 10,000 bird species for one century, for example, and one should observe just one extinction\n\n. . .\n\n-   1230 species of birds have been described since 1900.

For example, the genotype of a diploid individual characterized for the bi-allelic gene A might be A1A1, A1A2, or A2A2.                                                                                                                                             |\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n|                  | (continues)                                                                                                                           |\n|------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| Phenotype        | The obvious and measurable manifestation of a specific genotype.                                                                      |\n| Genome           | The set of nucleotide sequences, coding and not, generally organized into chromosomes, which characterize a species or an individual. |\n| Homozygote       | Individual with two identical copies of a specific allele registered at the locus (gene) of interest.                                 |\n| Heterozygote     | Individual with two different alleles characterized at the locus (gene) of interest.                                                  |\n| Allele frequency | The frequency of a specific allele in a population. The term gene frequency is often used to indicate the same concept.               |\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n|                        | (continues)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n|------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| Polymorphic            | The presence in a species or population of 2 or more alleles at a certain gene. For example, gene A in a population might have 4 alleles: A1, A2, A3, and A4. A locus is considered polymorphic if the frequency of its most frequent allele is less than 0.99 or 0.95. |\n| Monomorphic            | A population or species is monomorphic for a gene when all individuals have the same allele. In other words, the frequency of that allele in the population is 1.                                                                                                       |\n| Average heterozygosity | Average number of heterozygous loci in an individual or population.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Co-dominance           | Situation where all genotypes can be identified by their phenotypes. In the case of gene A with two codominant alleles, the A1A1, A1A2, and A2A2 genotypes all produce different and distinguishable phenotypes.                                                        |\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n|                   | (continues)                                                                                                                                                               |\n|------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| Allelic diversity | Mean number of alleles per locus.                                                                                                                                         |\n| Genetic distance  | A measure of distance obtained by comparing 2 or more nucleotide sequences or by comparing the allele and genotype frequencies of two or more individuals or populations. |\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Molecular techniques\n\n![Figure reproduced from @Allendorf2022](./molmarkers.png)\n\n## References\n",
