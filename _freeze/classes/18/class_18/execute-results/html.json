Commercial trade in Appendix I species is prohibited;\n    \n    - Appendix II species are those that either could be threatened by large volumes of trade or that cannot be distinguished from a threatened species. Trade involving species in this category has to be regulated and requires a permit from exporting country and one for importing countries\n    \n    - Appendix III. Species in this category are not globally threatened or endagered, but may be listed at the initiative of the individual states \n    \n- As of January 2017 there were 35801 species and 68 subspecies in the appendices with 97% of them in appendix II, 3% in appendix I and less than 1% in appendix III \n\n## References",
