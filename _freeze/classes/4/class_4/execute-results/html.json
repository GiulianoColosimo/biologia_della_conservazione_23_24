The process of extinction hardly happens over night, and is usually preceded by population decline [@VanDyke2020].\n\n---\n\n-   The simplest model of population dynamic can be understood as the sum of births (B) and migrants entering the populations (I) minus mortality (D) and individuals leaving or exiting the population (E).\n\n$$\n\\label{popmod}\n\\tag{4.1}\nN_{(t+1)} = N_{(t)} + (B_t + I_t) - (D_t + E_t)\n$$\n\n-   If a population is increasing exponentially (i.e., increasing with and increasing rate over time) its growth will be defined by $N$ and a rate of increase $r$ which is rate of birth minus rate of death.\n-   Without considering migration (neither in nor out of the population) $B$ becomes a function of birth rate ($b$) and the population size $N$.\n-   Similarly, the number of deaths ($D$) is a function of $d$ the per capita death rate, and population size.\n\n---\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](class_4_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){fig-align='center' width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n-   In exponential growth change in numbers over change in time is expressed as:\n\n$$\n\\label{expgrth}\n\\tag{4.2}\n\\frac{\\delta N}{\\delta t} = rN \n$$\n\n---\n\n-   The exponential growth curve is a good starting point, altough unrealistic for most species.\n-   A more realistic model should account for species' ecology and the fact that species exist in their environment.\n-   The limits imposed by the environment are usually identified using $K$, i.e. the carrying capacity.\n\n$$\n\\label{expgrthcc}\n\\tag{4.3}\n\\frac{\\delta N}{\\delta t} = rN (\\frac{K-N}{K})\n$$\n\n-   Changes in $N$ directly influence the growth rate of the population: density dependence.\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](class_4_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){fig-align='center' width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Capture-Mark-Recapture (CMR) experiments\n\n-   It is often impractical and impossible to count every single individual in a population.\n-   Capture-Mark-Recapture is a method to estimate the population's size.\n-   Some individual are captured and marked.\n-   The marked individuals are released in their environment.\n-   A second sampling trip is conducted and another portion of the individuals are collected.\n-   The number of marked individuals collected in the second expedition is expected to be proportional to the number of marked individuals in the entire population.\n-   It is important to have sufficient time between sampling occasions, to allow for the marked individuals to redistribute themselves among the unmarked population.\n\n## Tagging systems\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n-   A tagging system is a system allowing us to tag and label things to provide those things a unique identifier.\n-   People have been tagging animals (wild and captive) for hundreds of years and have developed different ways to tag pretty much every single living things.\n-   An animal tag can be as simple as a piece of metal or plastic with a number carved on it or with a standardized meaning.\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n![A male *Cyclura carinata* with colored bead tags.

He/she goes to the field and captures 15 individuals. These individuals are tagged and released on site. One week later the researcher comes back and catches 20 individuals, 10 of which are tagged.\n\nLets define some variables as:\n\n-   $N$ = Number of animals in the population.\n-   $n$ = Number of animals marked on the first visit.\n-   $K$ = Number of animals captured on the second visit.\n-   $k$ = Number of animals captured in the second visit that were marked (i.e., recaptured individuals).\n\nWe want to use the data we collected in the field to have an estimate of $N$.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Lincoln-Petersen estimator of N [@Seber1982]\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n-   Useful with only two sampling events.\n-   Assumes that $N$ is constant over the time of the experiment (i.e., there are no deaths or births).\n-   Assumes a closed population (i.e., there are no migrants).\n-   Catchability is the same among individuals, even the tagged ones.\n-   Tags are not lost between sampling events.\n-   Individuals have the time to randomly redistribute over their habitat.\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n-   $N$ = Number of animals in the population.\n-   $n$ = Number of animals marked on the first visit.\n-   $K$ = Number of animals captured on the second visit.\n-   $k$ = Number of animals captured in the second visit that were marked (i.e., recaptured individuals).\n\n$$\n\\label{lp}\n\\tag{4.4}\nN=\\frac{K*n}{k}\n$$\n:::\n:::\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Schnable estimator of $N$\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n-   Extension of the LP estimator.\n-   Same assumptions of LP.\n-   Allows to incorporate $s$ sampling events in the calculation.\n-   It depends simply on observing how the proportion of marked animals in catches increases as more animals have been marked [@Sutherland1996].\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n-   $N$ = Number of animals in the population.\n-   $n_i$ = Number of animals captured on $i^{th}$ visit.\n-   $m_i$ = Number of animals marked on $i^{th}$ visit.\n-   $k_i$ = Number of animals captured on $i^{th}$ visit that were marked (i.e., recaptured individuals).\n-   $s$ = Number of visits\n\n$$\n\\label{schnable}\n\\tag{4.5}\nN=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^s  n_i*m_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^s k_i}\n$$\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## References",
