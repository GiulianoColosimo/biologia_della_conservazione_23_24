It may be deeper and more complicated than that!\n. . .\n\n\n\nAre indigenous people really better than the industrialized civilization at conserving nature? Can we learn from them how to conserve it?\n. . .\n\nMany of the misconceptions concerning the apparent conservation proclivities of traditional peoples are a result of an imprecise understanding of what constitutes conservation (Alvard, 1993).\n\n\nIt is hard to imagine the evolution of behavioral traits beneficial to a group of individuals if these traits are contrary to the individual’s best interest (Williams, 1966).\n\n\nThere is little theoretical justification for expecting individuals to conserve open access resources (Alvard, 1993).\n\nA small group of individuals living in an abundant and productive environment can easily manage their resources in a sustainable way! For example, in a place with great abundance of prey, hunters can even be wasteful in their hunting, and yet cause little to no damage to the environment."

(Ordovician-Silurian 86%; Late Devonian 75%; Permian-Triassic 96%; Triassic-Jurassic 80%; Cretaceous. 65%; current number of species approx. 2.16 M; average life span for a species is 5 MY).\n\n\n\n\n\n100-((1*0.86)+(1*0.75)+(1*0.96)+(1*0.80)+(1*0.65))\n\n[1] 95.98\n\n\n\n\n\nThis means that 100% - 4% = 96% of all extinctions occurred outside the mass extinction events.\n\n\n\n\nThe results from this little exercise are not so distant from what has been known in the scientific literature (Raup, 1991).\n\n\n\n\nThese results tell us that extinction is a natural process."

    "text": "Background extinction rate.\n\nIf extinction is part of the natural process of evolution it should be possible to identify a background-extinction rate, i.e. the natural extinction rate during periods in between major extinction events.\nIf we can estimate a background-extinction rate it should also be possible to compare it across time to measure our current impact on biodiversity.\nThe value we just used (~5-10 MY) per species is a good approximation of the background extinction rate (Lawton & May, 1995) and falls under the categories of extinction rate intended as species survival rate.\nAnother way used to estimate extinction rate is based on the species-area estimate (Chisholm et al., 2018).\nOne of the estimate of extinction rate largely used is in million species years (MSY, Pimm, Raven, Peterson, Çağan, & Ehrlich, 2006)."

This assumption is very unlikely to be true in nature, especially because selection may be reduced for the loci under analysis, but still present at all other loci in an individual.\n\n\nNo immigration\nWe will first consider a situation where only one population of a certain species is present.

It provides a “null model” against which compare what we see in our data\nOnce we found that something is different between what we expect from the HW model and what we see in nature at the population genetic level, we can start investigate the relative role of the various evolutionary forces\n\n\n\n\nTesting a null hypothesis\n\nA fundamental aspect of every scientific discipline is the capability to discern between alternative hypotheses. The general approach is to present a formal or null-hypothesis (\\(H_0\\)) and a statistical test to estimate the probability that it holds true\nSuch test usually implies the calculation of a P-value (i.e., a probability distribution)\nLower P-values correspond to higher degree of certainty that the null is rejected and an alternative hypothesis (\\(H_1\\)) is preferred to explain the data\nWhen \\(P=0.002\\) it means that, if the null holds true, you expect to see a result as extreme or even more extreme than the one you have measured only 2 times out of 1000 experiment\nThe general threshold value (\\(\\alpha\\)) is \\(P=0.05\\), meaning that you have 5 chances in 100 of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true\n\n\n\n\nExcercise to test the HW proportions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem\n\n\n\nCalculate allele frequency, genotype frequency and expected genotype frequency.\n\n\n\n\nAllele frequency:\n\n\\[\np = f(A) = \\frac{2n_{11} + n_{12}}{2n} = \\frac{(2*907)+616}{2*1647} =0.738\n\\]\n\\[\nq = f(a) = \\frac{2n_{22} + n_{12}}{2n} = \\frac{(2*124)+616}{2*1647} =0.262\n\\]\n. . .\n\nObserved genotype frequency:\n\n\\[\nf(AA) =\\frac{n_{11}}{n}  = \\frac{907}{1647}=0.551; \\ \\ \\ f(Aa) =\\frac{n_{12}}{n}  = \\frac{616}{1647}=0.374\n\\]\n\\[\nf(aa) =\\frac{n_{22}}{n}  = \\frac{124}{1647}=0.075\n\\]\n\n\nExpected genotype frequency:\n\n\\[\np^2 = f(AA)^2 = 0.738^2 = 0.545; \\ \\ \\ 2pq = f(Aa) = 2*0.738*0.262=0.387\n\\]\n\\[\nq^2 = f(aa)=0.262^2=0.068\n\\]"

Small population size reduces the evolutionary potential of wildlife species (Frankham, 1996).\n\n\nThe importance of maintaining a large population size is pretty intuitive, but may not be enough!\nMany populations of insects and small mammals naturally fluctuate in their “census” population size, but it is when they are at their minimum that the genetic processes affect them the most\nOften the census population counts juveniles and senescent individuals that do not really contribute to the reproductive output of next generations\nWithin adult and reproductive individuals there may be significant variance in the number of offspring sired by males and females\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferent reproductive strategies (monogamy VS. polygamy) may as well influence the genetic output generation after generation\nTherefore it is necessary to distinguish between census population and an hypothetical idealized population\nWe can standardize this concept of idealized population by describing it in term of effective population size (\\(N_e\\)), and it can be defined as the actual number of breeding individuals needed in order to see the same variation of a critical parameter (such as genetic diversity) measured in the real population\nThe effective size of a population determines the rate of change in composition of a population caused by genetic drift (the random sampling of genetic variants) (Charlesworth, 2009, p. 195)\nTo better understand the origin of this concept of the idealized population see Wright (1931)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ideal population:\n\nAll individual in the population are considered adults and capable of breeding\nIndividuals are hermafroditic (self fertilization is possible)\nThe number of breeding individual is constant in all generations and they breed randomly\nNew individuals are formed each generation by random sampling, with replacement, of the gametes from the parents\nThe parents die after mating so each generation is only composed by new individuals (discrete generations)\nThere is no selection at any life stage and mutation is ignored\nWhen \\(N\\) is sufficiently large this means that each individual contributes to the next generation a number of offspring that is approximated by a Poisson distribution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAny characteristic of a real population that deviates from the characteristic of the ideal population will make the census size \\(N\\) to be different than the effective population size \\(N_e\\)\nAn important measure in conservation is the ratio \\(\\frac{N_e}{N}\\)\nThere are multiple evidence that in most natural population this ratio is usually much less than 1.\nThe primary factors influencing this ratio are:\n\nfluctuating population size over multiple generations\nhigh variance in family size\nunequal ratios between sexes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo estimate \\(N_e\\) it is possible to use demographic approaches and genetic approaches\n\n\n\n\nDemographic methodologies require extensive data and sometimes are unattainable in wild populations\n\n\nFluctuations in population sizeVariation in family sizeUnequal sex-ratio\n\n\n\n\n\nNatural populations continuously undergo fluctuations in size over multiple generations (Reed, OGrady, Ballou, & Frankham, 2003)\nWe can use the harmonic mean to estimate \\(N_e\\) over \\(t\\) generations\n\n\n\\[\nN_e \\sim \\frac{t}{\\sum(\\frac{1}{N_{ei}})} \\\\ \\sim \\frac{3}{(1/175000)+(1/20)+(1/175000)} \\sim 60\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe effect on \\(N_e\\) of variation in family sizes in an otherwise ideal population can be estimated using:\n\n\\[\nN_e = \\frac{4N-2}{V_k +2}\n\\]\n\n\n\\(k\\) is the mean family size\nIn Wright-Fisher population \\(V_k = 2\\) so that \\(N_e \\sim N\\)\nIn Darwin’s finches the value of \\(V_k\\) has been estimated at 6.74, which reduces dramatically \\(N_e\\) (Frankham, 1995)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Donald (2007) there usually is an excess of females in mammals and a deficiency in males \\[\nN_e=\\frac{4N_{ef}N_{em}}{N_{ef}+N_{em}}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nEffects of unequal sex ratio on \\(N_e/N\\). After Frankham, Ballou, & Briscoe (2010), p.249\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDNA retains information on the evolutionary history of individuals\nWe can use basic probability theory to extrapolate information, including information on \\(N_e\\) from DNA markers\nThe coalescent approach uses the sampling theory for neutral alleles and allows us to trace back in time this information (Rosenberg & Nordborg, 2002)\nUnder the neutral theory of evolution 2 alleles may descend from the same ancestral allele in the previous generation with probability \\(1/N_{ef}\\) for mtDNA, or \\(1/2N_e\\) for a general diploid locus\nAlternatively 2 alleles may derive from 2 different alleles in the previous generation with probability \\(1-\\frac{1}{N_{ef}}\\)\n\n\n\nUnder this neutral model of genetic drift the coalescence process takes a characteristic time:\n\n\\[\nT_k = \\frac{4N_e}{k(k-1)}generations\n\\] where \\(T_k\\) is the average time in generations back to the previous coalescent event when there were \\(k-1\\) alleles (Hedrick, 2005)\n\nThe time for all \\(k\\) alleles in the population to coalesce back to one allele is: \\(4N_e[1-(\\frac{1}{k})]\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe coalescent allows to study the loss of genetic diversity and to use this information to infer effective population size\nTo coalesce means “unite” or “fuse”\nTo better understand this approach we can look at the example of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)\nmtDNA is haploid, maternally inherited and it does not undergo recombination\nCoalescent theory provides a powerful framework to study the effects of genetic drift, natural selection, mutation, and gene flow in natural populations (Allendorf et al., 2022; Rosenberg & Nordborg, 2002)"

    "text": "What is inbreeding?\n\nIn its most simple definition inbreeding is the mating between related individuals.\nIn large population inbreeding can happen because of the non-random assortment of gametes. In many tree species spatially closer trees are more likely to be related than trees further apart.\n\n\n\n\nLarger filled circles indicate tree locations; open circles around them delineate seed shadows within which most seed will fall. Small symbols indicate seedlings from each maternal parent. After Allendorf et al. (2022), pg. 178\n\n\n\n\nCan inbreeding happen when there is random mating?\n\n. . .\n\nImagine the case of small populations. In the case of a population with 10 breeders, after a few generations the most distantly related individuals will be cousins, and even if the population mates at random, individuals will be highly inbred.\nThis has been called inbreeding effect of small populations (Crow & Kimura, 1970, pg. 101).\n\n. . .\n\nSo, we can consider an individual inbred if its parents share a common ancestor and its genes (one, two, or big chunks of the genome) are identical by descent (IBD).\nWhat we know from studying evolution and from the examples on the colaescence theory is that eventually all parents of an individual share a common ancestor.\nWe must, therefore, define inbreeding relative to some “base” population in which we assume all individuals are unrelated to one another (Allendorf et al., 2022, pg. 371).\n\n\n\nThe concept of inbreeding is relatively easy to understand, but can also be confusing as the same term is associated with different phenomena (gentic drift, non random mating within populations, increase in genome wide homozygosity).\nAll these concepts are measured by the same quantity, inbreeding coefficients (Templeton & Read, 1994), and all these concepts can, to certain degree, be used interchangeably as they all refer to a situation in which relatives mate with each other (Keller & Waller, 2002).\nAs inbred individuals receive two copies of the same allele from its parents, they will present higher homozygosity and lower heterozygosity throughout the entire genome.\nWe can, then, define the inbreeding coefficient (\\(F\\)) as that proportion of the genome in an individual that is IBD (sometime an alternative word is used, i.e., autozygous).\nThe alternative to autozygous is allozygous, which means that an individual possesses two alleles that are descendant from different ancestral alleles in the base population.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure from Allendorf et al.

    "text": "Inbreeding depression\n\nInbred individuals generally have reduced fitness in comparison to noninbred individuals from the same population because of their increased homozygosity.\nInbreeding depression is the reduction in fitness (or phenotype value) of progeny from matings between related individuals relative to the fitness of progeny between unrelated individuals\nInbreeding depression in natural populations contributes to the extinction of populations under some circumstances (Allendorf et al., 2022).\nThe importance of inbreeding depression has been debated since the time of Darwin. Even today, the importance of inbreeding depression is sometimes questioned by some conservationists and policy-makers.\n\n\n\n\n\nDid you know that Charles Darwin and his wife were cousins?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe concomitant contribution of different factors in determining a vortex effect leading the populations to extinction. Image downloaded here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA more recent take on extinction vortex (Allendorf et al., 2022).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInbreeding depression can result from either increased homozygosity or reduced heterozygosity.\nAren’t increased homozygosity or reduced heterozygosity two sides of the same coin?\n\n. . .\n\nYes, but the mechanism related to a fitness reduction is distinct! Increased homozygosity leads to expression of a greater number of deleterious recessive alleles in inbred individuals, thereby lowering their fitness. Reduced heterozygosity reduces fitness of inbred individuals at loci where the heterozygotes have a selective advantage over homozygotes (heterozygous advantage or overdominance).\n\nMost evidence show support for the primary problem of inbreeding depression is increased homozygosity (Allendorf et al., 2022).\n\n\n\n\n\nCallimico monkeys from the Connecticut Zoo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelationship between inbreeding (\\(F_P\\)) and infant survival in captive callimico monkeys (Lacy, 1997).\n\n\n\n\nIt is crucial to know the mechanisms causing inbreeding depression because it affects the ability of a population to “adapt” to inbreeding.\nA population could adapt to inbreeding if inbreeding depression is caused by deleterious recessive alleles that potentially could be removed (purged by selection).\nHowever, inbreeding depression caused by heterozygous advantage cannot be purged because overdominant loci will always suffer reduced fitness as homozygosity increases due to increased inbreeding (Allendorf et al., 2022).\nDeleterious recessive alleles are present in the genome of all species because they are continually introduced by mutation, and natural selection is inefficient at removing them because most copies are “hidden” phenotypically in heterozygotes that do not have reduced fitness (Allendorf et al., 2022).\nWe, therefore, expect all species to show some inbreeding depression due to the increase in homozygosity of recessive deleterious alleles.\n\n\n\nThe effects of inbreeding depression on survival are often measured by the mean number of “lethal equivalents” (LEs) per diploid genome.\nA lethal equivalent is a set of deleterious alleles that would cause death if homozygous.\nOne lethal equivalent may be a single allele that is lethal when homozygous, two alleles each with a probability of 0.5 of causing death when homozygous, or 10 alleles each with a probability of 0.10 of causing death when homozygous.\nThe number of LEs present in a species or population is generally estimated by regressing survival on the inbreeding coefficient.\nThe effects of inbreeding on the probability of survival, S, can be expressed as a function of \\(F_P\\) following Morton, Crow, & Muller (1956).\n\n\\[\n\\label{le}\n\\tag{10.3}\nS = e^{-(A+BF_P)} \\\\ ln \\ S= -A-BF_P\n\\]\nwhere \\(e^{-A}\\) is survival in an outbred population, and B is the inbreeding load.\n\n\n\n\nRelationship between inbreeding coefficient (F) and reduction in fitness. Inbreeding depression is the reduction in fitness of inbred individuals and measured by the number of LEs per gamete (B). The bracket shows the reduction in fitness (inbreeding depression) predicted for individuals with an F of 0.5. After Keller & Waller (2002) and Allendorf et al. (2022)."

Small population size reduces the evolutionary potential of wildlife species (Frankham, 1996).\n\n\nThe importance of maintaining a large population size is pretty intuitive, but may not be enough!\nMany populations of insects and small mammals naturally fluctuate in their “census” population size, but it is when they are at their minimum that the genetic processes affect them the most\nOften the census population counts juveniles and senescent individuals that do not really contribute to the reproductive output of next generations\nWithin adult and reproductive individuals there may be significant variance in the number of offspring sired by males and females\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferent reproductive strategies (monogamy VS. polygamy) may as well influence the genetic output generation after generation\nTherefore it is necessary to distinguish between census population and an hypothetical idealized population\nWe can standardize this concept of idealized population by describing it in term of effective population size (\\(N_e\\)), and it can be defined as the actual number of breeding individuals needed in order to see the same variation of a critical parameter (such as genetic diversity) measured in the real population\nThe effective size of a population determines the rate of change in composition of a population caused by genetic drift (the random sampling of genetic variants) (Charlesworth, 2009, p. 195)\nTo better understand the origin of this concept of the idealized population see Wright (1931)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ideal population:\n\nAll individual in the population are considered adults and capable of breeding\nIndividuals are hermafroditic (self fertilization is possible)\nThe number of breeding individual is constant in all generations and they breed randomly\nNew individuals are formed each generation by random sampling, with replacement, of the gametes from the parents\nThe parents die after mating so each generation is only composed by new individuals (discrete generations)\nThere is no selection at any life stage and mutation is ignored\nWhen \\(N\\) is sufficiently large this means that each individual contributes to the next generation a number of offspring that is approximated by a Poisson distribution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAny characteristic of a real population that deviates from the characteristic of the ideal population will make the census size \\(N\\) to be different than the effective population size \\(N_e\\)\nAn important measure in conservation is the ratio \\(\\frac{N_e}{N}\\)\nThere are multiple evidence that in most natural population this ratio is usually much less than 1.\nThe primary factors influencing this ratio are:\n\nfluctuating population size over multiple generations\nhigh variance in family size\nunequal ratios between sexes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo estimate \\(N_e\\) it is possible to use demographic approaches and genetic approaches\n\n\n\n\nDemographic methodologies require extensive data and sometimes are unattainable in wild populations\n\n\nFluctuations in population sizeVariation in family sizeUnequal sex-ratio\n\n\n\n\n\nNatural populations continuously undergo fluctuations in size over multiple generations (Reed, OGrady, Ballou, & Frankham, 2003)\nWe can use the harmonic mean to estimate \\(N_e\\) over \\(t\\) generations\n\n\n\\[\nN_e \\sim \\frac{t}{\\sum(\\frac{1}{N_{ei}})} \\\\ \\sim \\frac{3}{(1/175000)+(1/20)+(1/175000)} \\sim 60\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe effect on \\(N_e\\) of variation in family sizes in an otherwise ideal population can be estimated using:\n\n\\[\nN_e = \\frac{4N-2}{V_k +2}\n\\]\n\n\n\\(k\\) is the mean family size\nIn Wright-Fisher population \\(V_k = 2\\) so that \\(N_e \\sim N\\)\nIn Darwin’s finches the value of \\(V_k\\) has been estimated at 6.74, which reduces dramatically \\(N_e\\) (Frankham, 1995)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Donald (2007) there usually is an excess of females in mammals and a deficiency in males \\[\nN_e=\\frac{4N_{ef}N_{em}}{N_{ef}+N_{em}}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nEffects of unequal sex ratio on \\(N_e/N\\). After Frankham, Ballou, & Briscoe (2010), p.249\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDNA retains information on the evolutionary history of individuals\nWe can use basic probability theory to extrapolate information, including information on \\(N_e\\) from DNA markers\nThe coalescent approach uses the sampling theory for neutral alleles and allows us to trace back in time this information (Rosenberg & Nordborg, 2002)\nUnder the neutral theory of evolution 2 alleles may descend from the same ancestral allele in the previous generation with probability \\(1/N_{ef}\\) for mtDNA, or \\(1/2N_e\\) for a general diploid locus\nAlternatively 2 alleles may derive from 2 different alleles in the previous generation with probability \\(1-\\frac{1}{N_{ef}}\\)\n\n\n\nUnder this neutral model of genetic drift the coalescence process takes a characteristic time:\n\n\\[\nT_k = \\frac{4N_e}{k(k-1)}generations\n\\] where \\(T_k\\) is the average time in generations back to the previous coalescent event when there were \\(k-1\\) alleles (Hedrick, 2005)\n\nThe time for all \\(k\\) alleles in the population to coalesce back to one allele is: \\(4N_e[1-(\\frac{1}{k})]\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe coalescent allows to study the loss of genetic diversity and to use this information to infer effective population size\nTo coalesce means “unite” or “fuse”\nTo better understand this approach we can look at the example of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)\nmtDNA is haploid, maternally inherited and it does not undergo recombination\nCoalescent theory provides a powerful framework to study the effects of genetic drift, natural selection, mutation, and gene flow in natural populations (Allendorf et al., 2022; Rosenberg & Nordborg, 2002)"

In one of them, Hypericum cumulicola, gene flow was absent. The limited genetic variation detected in this species limits the adaptive response of it to future environmental changes and makes it more prone to extinction."

This method works because if gene flow (\\(Nm\\)) is low, populations will have numerous private alleles that arise through mutation, for example.\nThe time during which a new allele remains private depends only on migration rates, such that the proportion of alleles that are private decreases as migration rate increases. If gene flow is high, private alleles will be uncommon (Allendorf et al., 2022).\nThis method could be less biased than the \\(F_{ST}\\)-island model method, when using highly polymorphic markers, because it apparently is less sensitive to problems of homoplasy created by back mutations than is the \\(F_{ST}\\) method (Allen, Amos, Pomeroy, & Twiss, 1995)."

(Do you remember which is the first one?)\nAn estimated cost of non-native species in the US alone is over $120 billion annually (Crowl, Crist, Parmenter, Belovsky, & Lugo, 2008).\nThe role of humans as one of the most nefarious agent of disruption of biological communities is well recognized in the anthropocene epoch. One of the means of such disruption is undoubtedly tied to our transport of new species thousands of kilometers away from their native habitat (Dyke & Lamb, 2020).\n\n\nMake no mistake, we are seeing one of the great historical convulsions in the world’s fauna and flora (Elton, Simberloff, & Ricciardi, 2020, Elton’s original publication is from 1958).\n\n\n\nInternational commerce has aided and increased the movement of species worldwide and across taxonomic groups.\nOnly a fraction of transported species becomes established, and only \\(1\\%\\) become a pest, but addition and effects of all non native species, including pest species are cumulative over time.\n\n. . .\n\nCurrently New Zealand harbors more or less the same number of native plants and invasive plant species.\nArizona and Montana historically did not share any fish species. They now have about 33 species of fishes in common (Mooney & Cleland, 2001).\n\n. . .\n\nThese changes have occurred because humans transport species for their benefit, and invasive species use human means of transport to their benefit!\nOnce an invasive species has established and naturalized at regional or continental scale there is basically no hope to eradicate it.\n\n\n\n\n\nA typical sequence of invasion for most non-native species.

In the later case they can cause the death of the individual they attach to.\nThey are exceptionally good filter-feeders and they can alter the ecosystem by filtering huge amounts of phytoplankton, often the most important component of primary production in many aquatic systems.\nThe introduction in North America, in the late 80ies, caused a great deal of disruption in many biotic and abiotic components of the environment where they were introduced and spread.\nAmong others, this invaders altered water transparency, nutrient cycling, and benthic habitat structure as well as food web structure, bioaccumulation of contaminants, and the diversity of native freshwater mussels (Crowl et al., 2008; Strayer, 2009).\nAlong with the zebra mussel came also its own roundworm parasite (Bucephalus polymorphus) which caused the reduction in many cyprind fish species (Crowl et al., 2008; Dyke & Lamb, 2020).\n\n\n\n\n\nStrayer (2009)"

(2014) analyzed the effects of beavers in one of their non-native habitats, the islands comprising both the argentinian and chilean Tierra del Fuego, at the southern tip of South America.\nThey focused on the indirect and broader scale impact of invasive on ecosystems and landscapes (Anderson et al., 2014).\n\n\n\n\n\nCastor canadensis, image downloaded from this website."

Therefore, beavers have not completely dominated entire watersheds or the landscape by converting all streams to ponds.\nWhile they reduced the diversity of benthos as compared to that found in natural lotic patches, they only generated biotic assemblages in their engineered lentic patches that were very similar to those found in natural lentic habitats. For instance, we find such common taxa as midges and worms in beaver ponds, as well as other habitats. This subset of species is not unique to beaver ponds, but rather are mostly common species elsewhere\nTherefore, invasive beavers ultimately had no measurable influence on stream landscape-level biodiversity, but they did change the ecosystem function related to carbon cycling."

A classic example is provided by Rejmanek & Richardson (1996) who analyzed 24 species of pines (Pinus spp.) and actually moved them to different continents trying to study their invasive characteristics.\n\n12 species were classified as non invasive, planted on three continents but never reported as spreading.\n12 as invasive, as they spread on a t least two continents.\n\nThe authors of this study used discriminant analysys on 10 life history traits to document if there were certain characteristics that were commonly shared between the invasive species. They found three characteristics that were significant in predicting invasive potential of a species:\n\nSquare root of mean seeds mass.\nSquare root of minimum juvenile period.\nMean interval between large seeds crop.\n\n\n\nSuccessful pine invaders had low mass of individual seeds, short juvenile periods and short intervals between large seed crops (Dyke & Lamb, 2020).\n\nThe first trait allowed the species to disperse more easily than species with heavier seeds. The other two characteristics ensured to have fast and constant reproduction once established in a new area.\n\n. . .\nOver time researchers have introduced other principles that may help in explaining the success of invaders in multiple contexts.\n\nMore individuals are released rather than less.\nMore release sites are used rather than fewer.\nReleases are repeated multiple times.\n\nIn other words, non-native species that can invade in large numbers and many sites in repeated efforts will have better chances at successfully invading new areas."

    "section": "Forming a theory of invasive biology",
    "text": "Forming a theory of invasive biology\n\nScientists concerned with the dynamics of invasive species have traditionally resorted to one of three categories of models to explain successful invasions.\nNon-spatial models are the simplest. In these models there is nothing related to the actual physical location of the propagules and everything is done using projections that are derived from demographic analyses, including the application of exponential or logistic growth equations.\nSpatially implicit models include data on how the spatial structure of the environment influences the growth process. This models are based mostly on regression equations to forecast the rate of change in population growth as the species encounters physical and ecological variation in the new environment.\nSpatially explicit models include the actual spatial location of invasive organisms and knowledge of the contagious process (site- or habitat-specific rate of growth or death of a propagule) to predict the rate and manner of invasive spread (Dyke & Lamb, 2020).\n\n\nSkellam (1991) described the invasion process of an organism as a reaction-diffusion equation:\n\\[\n\\label{diffeq}\n\\tag{17.1}\nV = s\\sqrt{rD}\n\\]\nwhere \\(V\\) represents the wave velocity of the advancing front, \\(r\\) is the population intrinsic rate of increase and \\(D\\) is the diffusion coefficient equal to one half the mean distance moved in a time unit by an organism (Godfray & Crawley, 1998).\nWe can expand the model to include also spatial heterogeneity using the form:\n\\[\n\\label{diffeq2}\n\\tag{17.2}\nV = s\\sqrt{r_aD_h}\n\\]\nwhere \\(r_a\\) is the arithmetic mean of the population’s intrinsic growth rate across patches, and \\(D_h\\) is the harmonic mean of the diffusion coefficient across patches.\nBoth models seem to work well in a variety of situations, but fail to produce biological meaningful results in certain taxa (Dyke & Lamb, 2020).\n\n\nA potential problem with the reaction-diffusion models is that redistribution of invading individuals is assumed to occur as a random dispersal process and dispersal and reproduction of individuals is assumed to be happen simultaneously and continuously (Dyke & Lamb, 2020).\nMany insects, for example, behave differently depending on the life stage they are in. For example, the dispersal phase is usually in a different life stage than reproduction. Long distance dispersal events are, therefore, although rare, may be very important.\nIntegro-difference-equations (IDE) allow to incorporate long distance dispersal function and state specific reproduction and dispersal. All IDEs have the general form:\n\n\\[\n\\label{ide}\n\\tag{17.3}\nNt+1(x) =k(x, y)f[Nt(y)]dy\n\\]\nwith \\(Nt+1(x)\\), the population density at some destination point \\(x\\), a function of the population growth at each point \\(y\\) \\((f[Nt(y)])\\), and the movements of individuals from a dispersal point \\(y\\) to destination point \\(x\\) is a function of the shape of the dispersal kernel \\(k\\).\n\n\nInvasive species can be classified as an Anthropocene problem (Dyke & Lamb, 2020). To manage them, thus, it makes sense to look at them from and anthropogenic perspective. For example, we can ask the question: how do invasive species interact and often take advantage of human modifications of the natural environment?\n\n. . .\n\nKueffer & Daehler (2009) propose four different habitat types with categories varying in the degree of human habitat modification and valuation of these habitats.\n\nAnthropogenic habitat. Highly disturbed areas such as plantation forestry or hurban settlement.\nReference habitat. Relatively undisturbed, dominated by native species.\nAbandoned habitat. Habitats with currently very low human activities and disturbances but that once experienced heavy disturbance.\nDesigned habitat. Human modified habitats that are artificially designed to restore biodiversity and favor native flora and fauna.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHabitat type\nHabitat characteristics\nTraits of invader\nImpacts of invader\nManagement actions\nResearch focus\n\n\n\n\nAnthropogenic habitat\nDisturbed or anthropogenic\n“Weedy” invaders such as ruderal or early successional species\nReservoir for invasions into biodiversity areas.

    "text": "What is climate and what is climate change?\n\nWeather refers to local, short-term changes in variables such as temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and humidity. Weather is constantly changing, but changing within a range of historical norms, cycles or fluctuations that, in the long term, are highly predictable (Dyke & Lamb, 2020).\nThese long term predictable fluctuations are what is meant by climate (Dyke & Lamb, 2020).\n\n\n\nRegular periodic variation in climate is a kind of predictable change manifested in annual seasonal cycles and in the long term regular fluctuations.\n\n\n\n\nPeriodicity of annual variation.\nMilankovitch cycles."

    "text": "How contemporary changes differ from past changes.\n\nThe range of temperatures on earth is driven by the absorpion of solar radiation from the sun.\nThe average earth net income of such solar radiation is \\(342 \\ W/m^2\\) (Lovejoy, 2008).\nAbout \\(31\\%\\) of such energy is reflected back in space and never reaches the surface.\nThe rest of the radiation is reflected and when it happens the emitted radiation is changed in wave length to long infrared radiation. This is an important passage because infrared radiation can become trapped by the so called Greenhouse gasses (GHG) such as water vapor (\\(H_2O\\)), methane (\\(CH_4\\)), ozone (\\(O_3\\)), nitrous oxide (\\(N_2O\\)), and carbon dioxide (\\(CO_2\\)).\nThis absorption creates an additional net influx of energy to the earth.\nTo conserve the energy balance of the system there must be some change in non-radiative energy, including temperature!"

(2014), it could be possible to classify conservation actions as either fine-filter or coarse-filter, with a portfolio of strategies that can be implemented. The authors further use the metaphor of a theater to better explain the rationale behind chosing a stratey that would save the actors or the stage.\nDecision on what are the best strategies to use depends on the answers to three key management questions: where?

Most of the fresh water is tied up in glaciers and ice sheets, which means that only a relatively small portion is available to sustain human, plant and animal life.\n\n\n\nThis is the link to the climate change quizzes!\n\n\n\nWhich of these has a greater effect on global sea level?\n\nMelting sea ice\nMelting land ice\na and b combined\nExtreme precipitation events\nNone of the above\n\n\n. . .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nb)\n\n\n\nSea level rise is caused primarily by two factors related to global warming: the added water from melting land ice and the expansion of seawater as it warms. Melting sea ice does not contribute nearly as much to ocean water volume because floating ice displaces water in an amount equal to its volume. Some coastal regions and island nations have begun to experience the consequences of sea level rise. Rising seas not only affect dwellings and infrastructure, but fresh water is also affected as rising saltwater begins to contaminate it through “saltwater intrusion.”\n\n\n\n\nMeasurements of Earth’s gravitational field permit topographic, or surface, mapping of the ocean floor.\n\nTrue\nFalse\n\n\n. . .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrue\n\n\n\nUndersea mountain ranges like the the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, chains of islands and sea mounts like the strand from Hawai’i Island past Midway to the Aleutian Islands chain, and deep sea trenches like the Japan Trench can be identified in data collected by the GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) spacecraft. The additional mass of rock that composes the undersea mountains and the lack of rock in trenches provide gravitational telltales that GRACE can detect.\n\n\n\n\nThe only current that makes an uninterrupted circle around the entire Earth without hitting land is the:\n\nGulf stream\nJapan current\nCalifornia current\nAntarctic Circumpolar Current\nMonsoons\n\n\n. . .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd)\n\n\n\nOcean currents are driven by ocean winds and influenced by the “Coriolis effect.” Water flows along the current until it encounters land, where the Coriolis effect causes the current to rotate clockwise in the northern hemisphere and counterclockwise in the south. Most currents form “gyres,” or large systems of rotating ocean currents. The gyre’s rotational patterns draw in debris from across the ocean, while wind patterns push the trash toward the center, trapping it there. In the Southern Ocean around Antarctica, there is no land, which allows the Antarctic Circumpolar Current to travel around the globe uninterrupted.\n\n\n\n\nTides are caused by:\n\nThe wind\nEarthquakes\nThe moon’s gravitational pool\nThe gravitational pool of both the moon and the sun\nPeople swimming\n\n\n. . .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd)\n\n\n\nBoth the sun and the moon influence tide rise and fall, which are caused by the gravitational attraction between the ocean and the moon as well as the ocean and the sun. “Centrifugal force” — the same force that pulls you backward on the teacup ride at Disneyland – is generated from Earth’s spin and is another factor that influences Earth’s tides.\n\n\n\n\nAbout how much of Earth’s surface is covered by clouds at any given time?\n\n\\(15\\%\\)\n\\(30\\%\\)\n\\(60\\%\\)\n\\(90\\%\\)\n\\(95\\%\\)\n\n\n. . .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nc)\n\n\n\nCovering most of the Earth at any given moment, clouds have a huge—but insufficiently understood—impact on climate.\n\n\n\n\nWhat effects do various aerosols have on the climate?\n\nReflect sunlight back in to space, cooling the planet\nProvide a platform for water droplets and ice crystals to form and develop in to cloud\nIncrease the brightness of clouds making them reflect more sunlight in to space\nAbsorb sunlight, heat the surrounding air and prevent cloud formation\nAll of the above\na, b, and c\n\n\n. . .\n\n\n\n\n\n\ne)\n\n\n\nThat’s part of what makes aerosols so hard to pin down in climate models. Various kinds of aerosols have various kinds of effects, both direct and indirect. As a direct effect, aerosols scatter sunlight back into space. As an indirect effect, they can either help or hinder the development of clouds, which in turn can either cool or warm the planet.\n\n\n\n\nThe brighter a cloud looks, the less pollution it contains.\n\nTrue\nFalse\n\n\n. . .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFalse\n\n\n\nA given volume of pollution-rich cloud tends to have more numerous and smaller droplets than in more pristine clouds. The high number of small droplets provides more surfaces to reflect light, making the cloud appear brighter than a cloud consisting of fewer and larger droplets.\n\n\n\n\nDo clouds heat or cool Earth?\n\nHeat\nCool\nBoth heat and cool\nNeither heat nor cool\n\n\n. . .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nc)\n\n\n\nDifferent kinds of clouds at different altitudes play different roles in regulating Earth’s temperature. Wispy clouds at high altitudes tend to trap infrared radiation emitted by the sun-warmed Earth, which prevents it from escaping into space and warms the atmosphere. On the other hand, thick, low-lying clouds tend to cool the planet by shading Earth’s surface, reflecting sunlight back into space. Scientists are trying to determine how global warming will affect the balance we’ve been enjoying up to now."

Economics also studies the results of these choices and how they affect the society (Frank & Bernanke, 2012).\nSpeaking of economics within conservation science may seem a paradox, because economics is often an obstacle or a limit to the development of conservation strategies and the achievement of conservation goals.\nAfter all, we live in a largely capitalistic world, and increasing the capital, which often translates to increasing the bank account, is the goal of most corporations worldwide.\nDespite this, thinking like an economist or at least including a few economics notions in the way we think and develop conservation strategies can help to device appropriate conservation actions when resources are lacking or very few.\n\n\n\nNo conservation effort or practice can ultimately endure without an intimate connection to value (Dyke & Lamb, 2020)."

A comprehensive list is hard to make. So, we can classify them based on how we use them.\nStock-flow resources are those goods produced via a transformation process, usually self-renewing, occurring within the ecosystem itself. Goods extracted can then be used at a certain rate (flow) from the resource’s stock.\nTimber from a forest is the classical example of a stock-flow resource. A standing stock of mature trees transforms water, sunlight and nutrients from the soil into new biomass and new individuals. It is important in the process of creating the resource, and becomes itself the resource.\nIf a stock-flow resources is extracted at a rate \\(\\le\\) than its renewal rate, we can consider that resource self-perpetuating.\nAll stock-flow resources share similar attributes."

Can you exclude someone from breathing oxygen?\nSome ecosystem and good services are also non-rival, in that the use of the good does not infringe on the use from other.\nBecause of these characteristics (nonexcludable and nonrival) these goods (like climate and water surfaces) are outside of the marketplace and are considered public goods."

If people can use the good regardless of whether or not they have to pay for it, they are considerably less likely to pay for it.

However, if the current erosion were lower than the maximum, the implication for the ecosystem supply were positive.\nProperly developed, environmental markets can stimulate market efficiency and improve overall economic efficiency while supporting higher level of biodiversity conservation.\nTo do this, economists must address externalities, the costs or benefits that are not explicitly captured in a decision or action!"

Goods extracted can then be used at a certain rate (flow) from the resource’s stock.\nTimber from a forest is the classical example of a stock-flow resource. A standing stock of mature trees transforms water, sunlight and nutrients from the soil into new biomass and new individuals. It is important in the process of creating the resource, and becomes itself the resource.\nA fund-service is something that can gradually be reduced or worn out, and it does not become a part of the resource it produces. The fund provides a service at a fixed rate so that the service is best measured in some metric that describes the output over time.\nFor example, from 2007 to 2016 terrestrial ecosystems globally removed an estimated 3.61 Pg (petagrams) C per year from the atmosphere which amounts to 33.7% of total anthropogenic emissions from industrial activity and land-use change (Keenan & Williams, 2018)."
