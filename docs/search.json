By the end of the course the students should develop autonomy in the process of understanding of different approaches and methods, consolidating the awareness that conservation biology is a crisis discipline that requires specific analytical skills to guide appropriate interventions.\nStudents are expected to develop professional language and communication skills through a continuous interaction with the teacher and interventions during classes. Additionally, students are guided in the understanding of the discipline through the access to primary literature in English. The process of development such skills is monitored by written periodical checks, with open questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAttendance is mandatory!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead carefully!\n\n\n\nIt is a student’s responsibility to periodically check this website to make sure he/she has the most updated information about the course schedule and content.
