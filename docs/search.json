By the end of the course the students should develop autonomy in the process of understanding of different approaches and methods, consolidating the awareness that conservation biology is a crisis discipline that requires specific analytical skills to guide appropriate interventions.\nStudents are expected to develop professional language and communication skills through a continuous interaction with the teacher and interventions during classes.

It may be deeper and more complicated than that!\n. . .\n\n\n\nAre indigenous people really better than the industrialized civilization at conserving nature? Can we learn from them how to conserve it?\n. . .\n\nMany of the misconceptions concerning the apparent conservation proclivities of traditional peoples are a result of an imprecise understanding of what constitutes conservation (Alvard, 1993).\n\n\nIt is hard to imagine the evolution of behavioral traits beneficial to a group of individuals if these traits are contrary to the individual’s best interest (Williams, 1966).\n\n\nThere is little theoretical justification for expecting individuals to conserve open access resources (Alvard, 1993).\n\nA small group of individuals living in an abundant and productive environment can easily manage their resources in a sustainable way! For example, in a place with great abundance of prey, hunters can even be wasteful in their hunting, and yet cause little to no damage to the environment."

In particular, 1 extinction (E) per \\(10^6\\) species-years (MSY) (Pimm et al., 2014; Pimm, Raven, Peterson, Çağan, & Ehrlich, 2006)\nIt tells us how many extinctions we should expect in any sample where the sum of all of the years over all of the species under consideration is one million.\nFor example, follow the fates of 10,000 bird species for one century and one should observe just one extinction (i.e., 1 E/MSY according to Pimm et al., 2006).\nSince 1900, 98,334 species of birds have been described and 13 have gone extinct\n\n\n(13*10^6)/98334\n\n[1] 132.2025"

It provides a “null model” against which compare what we see in our data\nOnce we found that something is different between what we expect from the HW model and what we see in nature at the population genetic level, we can start investigate the relative role of the various evolutionary forces\n\n\n\n\nTesting a null hypothesis\n\nA fundamental aspect of every scientific discipline is the capability to discern between alternative hypotheses. The general approach is to present a formal or null-hypothesis (\\(H_0\\)) and a statistical test to estimate the probability that it holds true\nSuch test usually implies the calculation of a P-value (i.e., a probability distribution)\nLower P-values correspond to higher degree of certainty that the null is rejected and an alternative hypothesis (\\(H_1\\)) is preferred to explain the data\nWhen \\(P=0.002\\) it means that, if the null holds true, you expect to see a result as extreme or even more extreme than the one you have measured only 2 times out of 1000 experiment\nThe general threshold value (\\(\\alpha\\)) is \\(P=0.05\\), meaning that you have 5 chances in 100 of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true\n\n\n\n\nExcercise to test the HW proportions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem\n\n\n\nCalculate allele frequency, genotype frequency and expected genotype frequency.\n\n\n\n\nAllele frequency:\n\n\\[\np = f(A) = \\frac{2n_{11} + n_{12}}{2n} = \\frac{(2*907)+616}{2*1647} =0.738\n\\]\n\\[\nq = f(a) = \\frac{2n_{22} + n_{12}}{2n} = \\frac{(2*124)+616}{2*1647} =0.262\n\\]\n. . .\n\nObserved genotype frequency:\n\n\\[\nf(AA) =\\frac{n_{11}}{n}  = \\frac{907}{1647}=0.551; \\ \\ \\ f(Aa) =\\frac{n_{12}}{n}  = \\frac{616}{1647}=0.374\n\\]\n\\[\nf(aa) =\\frac{n_{22}}{n}  = \\frac{124}{1647}=0.075\n\\]\n\n\nExpected genotype frequency:\n\n\\[\np^2 = f(AA)^2 = 0.738^2 = 0.545; \\ \\ \\ 2pq = f(Aa) = 2*0.738*0.262=0.387\n\\]\n\\[\nq^2 = f(aa)=0.262^2=0.068\n\\]"

The \\(15^{th}\\) will not be able to do so as only one car will be remaining. Similarly, if you calculated the mean of a sample of 15 numbers, the first 14 numbers can vary freely, but the value of the \\(15^{th}\\) number is determined as the value needed to achieve the given sample mean!\nDegrees of freedom for tests for Hardy–Weinberg proportions are estimated according to: \\(df=\\# genotypes − \\# alleles\\). This is because the number of genotypes in a population can not vary freely, but is bound to the number of alleles present in that population"
